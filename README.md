# CHILD WELLBEING MONITOR (CWBM) PROJECT

## Introduction

Child wellbeing is an issue of global significance especially in developing or 
Lower Income Countries (LICs) where general standard of living falls below optimum. 
Child wellbeing refers to the quality of life of a child or young adult. 
It is a multidimensional topic which different researchers 
have tried to conceptualise and measure using various methods. 

One method, conceptualizes child wellbeing from two broad perspectives: 
- ___objective wellbeing___; physical, health, educational and financial wellbeing, and 
- ___subjective or psychological wellbeing___; child satisfaction, happiness, emotional and social wellbeing _(Statham and Chase, 2010)_. 

Another approach conceptualizes child wellbeing under five categories as follows: 
- poverty, needs, social exclusion, quality of life and 

The __Child Wellbeing Monitor (CWBM)__ provides a tool to understand and measure 
child wellbeing in LICs using __Ethopia__, __India__, __Peru__, and __Vietnam__
as case studies. 

Data from the "Young Lives Survey" hosted by the UK Data Service which consists of 
panel data from 2002 to 2016  was analysed and organized into a 
relational database to help understand child wellbeing in LICs.

## Objectives

> Specific objective of this project were as follows
1.  To develop a full database for understanding and measuring child wellbeing in Ethiopia, 
India, Peru and Vietnam, using data from the Young Lives Survey.

2. To include schema, schema diagram, tables, views, stored procedures, user defined functions
and triggers as part of the database fucntionality for efficiency and security.

3. To create five summarized reports that helps the client understand and measure child 
wellbeing.

4. To address issues of transaction concurrency, database security, backup and data privacy as 
part of the database design.
